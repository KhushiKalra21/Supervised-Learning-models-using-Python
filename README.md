# Supervised Learning Models using Python

## **Overview**
- **Type:** Individual Project  
- **Objective:** Analyze a dataset to build and evaluate classification models, explore clustering methods, and reduce dimensionality.  
- **Key Techniques:**  
  - **Classification:** Logistic Regression, SVM, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)  
  - **Clustering:** K-Means, DBSCAN, BIRCH  
  - **Dimensionality Reduction:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  

## **Dataset**
The dataset includes financial and demographic variables. Data preprocessing, normalization, and encoding techniques were applied to prepare the data for analysis.

## **Project Overview**  
This is an individual project that implements supervised learning techniques to classify and predict a target variable. The dataset used is preprocessed and analyzed to build effective machine learning models.  

## **Key Features**  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Missing data handled, categorical variables encoded, and features scaled.  
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applied PCA for feature reduction.  
- **Supervised Learning Models**: Built and evaluated Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Stochastic Gradient Descent classifiers.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance measured using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## **How Itâ€™s Useful**  
- Provides insights into classification tasks.  
- Demonstrates step-by-step supervised learning model building using Python.
